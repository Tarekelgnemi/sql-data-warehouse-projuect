👋 Welcome to My First Data Warehouse Project!

This repository contains my first project on GitHub, where I’m building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate and analyze sales data from multiple sources.
This project marks the beginning of my journey into data engineering and analytics, and I’m excited to share my progress, learn from feedback, and continuously improve.
The solution is designed to improve data accessibility, enhance reporting capabilities, and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
Consolidate fragmented sales data into a unified warehouse.
Improve data quality, integrity, and consistency.
Enable efficient reporting and analytics.
Create a scalable structure for future data sources.

🏗️ Technologies Used
SQL Server (Data warehouse development)
ETL/ELT processes for data loading and transformation
T-SQL for queries, transformations, and modelling
Optional BI Layer (Power BI / SSRS — if applicable)

📊 Key Components
Dimensional modelling (Star Schema)
Fact and Dimension tables for sales reporting
Automated data ingestion and transformations
Aggregations for analytical queries

🚧 Project Status
Currently ongoing with continuous enhancements planned.
